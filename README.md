## booking.py<br />
Software that automates the process of checking for available time slots when booking/rescheduling your license. The program accesses the licence booking login page. It automates all searching processes for available time slots, including logging in, filtering locations and displaying available slots in the next four months. However, at this stage, users must manually hardcode their login info and booking location.
- ### Tech Stack<br />
  - Python 3.10
  - Selenium 4.18
- ### Ideas for Future Implementations <br />
  - Use dynamic values for filling in the login info and desired location.
  - Implement GUI or input fields so the user can provide data without having to access code.
  - Implement more options for users, such as rescheduling or cancelling their booking.
  - Use a database to store login info and location data.
